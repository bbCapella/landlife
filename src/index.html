                <h2>Uncutting the cord</h2>

                <p>
                    There was once a time when people were free to live uninterrupted.
                    It was a place of peace and tranquility where one was able think with clear coherent thoughts
                    for extended periods of time. The only constant connections were the neuro connections that
                    were being formed and strengthed from performing complex tasks such as recalling phone numbers
                    and navigating without GPS. Is such a life possible today? The answer is yes!
                    And no you do not need to give up Twitter, FaceBook, SnapChat or any of your favorite apps!
                    Landlife will help you to get the best of both worlds.
